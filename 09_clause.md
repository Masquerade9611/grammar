# 从句

## 从句的原理

### 句子成分

句子成分上来说，除谓语动词以外所有的句子成分都可以用从句代替

**主语** + 动词
主语 + 动词 + **宾语**
主语 + 动词 + 间接宾语 + 直接宾语
主语 + 动词 + 宾语 + **（宾语）补语**
主语 + 动词 + **（主语）补语（表语）**
**定语**，**状语**，**同位语**

### 词类/词性

名词性从句
    - 主语从句
    - 宾语
    - 表语
    - 宾语补语
    - 同位语

形容词性从句
    - 定语从句

副词性从句
    - 状语从句
        - 时间状语
        - 地点状语
        - 条件，原因，方式，比较…状语从句

## 形容词从句 / 定语从句

### 思维方式

The rabbit is eating a carrot.

中：兔子在吃一根（我买来的）胡萝卜。
英：兔子在吃一根胡萝卜（[胡萝卜的关系词]我买）。

### 构成

The rabbit is eating carrots（先行词） **that（关系词） I bought**（定语从句）.

关系词
    - 关系代词
    - 关系副词

关系代词  
that vs. whitch  
先行词是唯一的：that  
先行词是多选一的：which  

    The rabbit ate **the largest carrot** that I've ever seen.
    The rabbit ate a carrot which I bought.

关系副词  
This was the place where the rabbit ate the carrot.  
This is the reason why the rabbit ate the carrot.  
That was the day when the rabbit ate the carrot for the first time.  

    转为关系代词
    the place **at which**
    the reason **for which**
    the day **on which**
关系副词 = 介词 + which

### 限定性和非限定性

限定性形容词从句
    The rabbit ate the carrot which was on the table.
    限定了carrot的范围、性质

非限定性形容词从句
    The rabbit ate the carrot, **which** was on the table.
    一前一后两段话，which表示"接着说"

I have a head which is round.
I have a head, which is round.

非限定性形容词从句作插入语
    My head, **which is big**, is useful when it rains.  
    The biggest carrot, **which the rabbit ate**, was on the table.  
    仅作补充信息作用，删除后无影响

非限定性形容词从句指代整句话
    The rabbit ate the carrot, **which** was not surprising.  
    which指代“兔子吃了胡萝卜”这件事

## 名词从句

- 主语从句
- 宾语
- 表语
- 宾语补语
- 同位语

### 主语从句

The fact is obvious.  

**That** the rabbit ate a carrot is obvious.  
（引导词，从属连词）
**Whether** the rabbit ate a carrot is obvious.  
**Where** the rabbit ate a carrot is obvious.  
**When** the rabbit ate a carrot is obvious.  
**How** the rabbit ate a carrot is obvious.  
**Who** ate a carrot is obvious.  
**What** the rabbit ate a carrot is obvious.  

That the hungry rabbit had already eaten a carrot for dinner this evening is obvious.  
->  
**It**(形式主语) is obvious that the hungry rabbit had already eaten a carrot for dinner this evening.  

### 宾语从句

1. 确定信息 & 不确定信息

    确定信息作宾语
    I saw that the rabbit ate a carrot.

    不确定信息作宾语
    I saw whether the rabbit ate a carrot.  
    I saw who ate the carrot.  
    I saw what the rabbit ate.  
    I saw where the rabbit ate a carrot.
    when
    how

2. 引导词that的省略  

    I know the rabbit ate a carrot.  

3. 某些词后的宾语从句的否定

    否定加在谓语动词前，而非从句中
    I think (that) the rabbit is smart.
    -> I don't think (that) the rabbit is smart.

    I don't believe (that) you will give me some conins.  
    I don't except (that) you will give this video a thumps-up.  

4. 主从时态一致

    主句时态 = 宾语从句时态  
    I don't think you're right.  
    I didn't think you were right.  
    I knew the rabbit liked carrots.  
    （例外：不变的客观现象）
    I knew the sun raise in the east.

5. be + 形容词 + that ...

    I am sure that there's a carrot on the table.  
    I am happy that there's a carrot on the table.  
    I am afraid that there's no carrot on the table.  

    根据语义理解不同，可能划分为宾语从句、同位语从句、状语从句

### 表语从句

I（主语） am(系动词，“划等号”) a rabbit（主语补语）.  
The carrot tastes good.  

系动词：be动词  
    The problem is **that** the rabbit is hungry.  
    The reason is **that** there's no more carrot.  
    The question is **whether** the rabbit is hungry.  
    The question is **what** the rabbit shoud eat.  
    The question is **where/when/how** the rabbit should eat the carrot.  

系动词：非be动词  
    It seems that the rabbit is hungry.  
    It feels that you're not telling the truth.  

### 同位语从句

My teacher, Papa Rabbit（同位语）, likes carrots.  

The fact **that** the rabbit ate the carrot did not surprise me.  
The question **whether** the rabbit will eat the carrot is on all our minds.  
I have no idea **who** ate the carrot.  
（宾语idea，后接的同位语从句将idea重新定义）

### 宾语补语从句

    复杂及物动词  ->  主语 + 动词 + 宾语 + 宾语补语

You can call me Papa Rabbit.  
You can call me what you like.  

My education made me who I am today.  

## 副词从句/状语从句

- 表时间
- 表地点
- 表条件
- 表让步
- 表方式
- 表比较
- 表原因
- 表目的
- 表结果

### 时间副词从句

1. 某一时间点之前
    引导词：before

    The rabbit ate a carrot at home(主句) **before** the wolf stopped by(从句).
    **Before** the wolf stopped by(从句), the rabbit ate a carrot at home(主句).

2. 某一时间点之中（当时）
    引导词：when, whild, as

    The rabbit was eating a carrot **when** I reached home.  
    **When** I reached home, the rabbit was eating a carrot.

    The rabbit was eating a carrot whild I was making a video.  
    I ate a carrot as I made the video.  

    三者不同之处
    1. when: 时间的，“突然”
    2. while: 时间段
    3. as: 同时

3. 某一时间点之后
    引导词：after

    The rabbit ate a carrot **after** the wolf stopped by.  

4. 从之前某一时间点开始算  
    引导词：since，往往对后续有影响

    The rabbit has shared three carrots **since** the wolf stopped by.

5. 直到之后某一时间点
    引导词：until

    The rabbit waited **until** the wolf stopped by.  

6. 一...就...
    引导词：as soon as  

    The rabbit will eat a carrot **as soon as** the wolf leaves.  

7. 下次
    引导词：the next time

    The rabbit will share the biggest carrot **the next time** the wolf stops by.

### 地点副词从句

引导词：where + "强调形式"

    The rabbit ate the carrot **where** he found it.

    The rabit will go **wherever** he can find a carrot.  
    The rabbit sees a carrot **everywhere** he goes.  
    The rabbit can eat a carrot **anywhere** he likes.  

### 比较副词从句

    He is smarter **than I am**.  

    This carrot is bigger **than that one is**.  

    She is more beautiful **than Snow White is**.  

    He is as smart as I am.  

    The more you practice English, the more fluent you become.  

## 条件副词从句

    If the rabbit sees a carrot, he will eat it.  

- PS:“主将从现”
  - “现”所代表的一般现在时态，无明确的时间划分，重点为“一般” 只表示一种状态/属性  
  - 一般将来时态表示非常确定会发生的事情，"You will get it"  
  - 从句部分，在表达“如果”这个概念时不确定是否会发生，所以只能用一般时态  
  - 主句部分，在从句假设的条件成立的状态下，非常确定会去做某事，所以用一般将来时表示

条件句在时态上总是比主句落后一个时间段  

其他引导词 unless, provided, as long as, in case

    Unless you like thiss video, you will not give it a thumps-up.  
    Provided that mu video is excellent, you will give it a thumbs-up.  
    As long as I make excellent videos, you will remain my follower.  
    In case you don't understand, please comment below.  

## 让步副词从句

即使/就算……也……
(虚拟) Even if I see a carrot, I will not eat it.  
(真实) Although(though/ even though) I see a carrot, I will not eat it.  

    PS: 中文中需要“虽然”“但是”二者搭配，而英文不需要后者“but”，因为出现前者"引导词"已经构成了复杂句，而"连词"but将会去构成一个复合句，所以不能一起使用。  

no matter / regardless of + 疑问句  
    No matter what happens, I will not eat the carrot.  
    不管发生什么事，我都不会吃这胡萝卜。

    Regardless of what kind of video I make, you will give it a thumbs-up.

## 方式副词从句

    I feel good **as if I had just eaten a carrot**.  
    (主句交代一个确认的情况) (从句表达一个与事实相反的假设)
    我感觉良好，就像我刚吃了根胡萝卜一样。  

    You spend (so much) money as if you were a millionare.

    Eat the carrot as I do.  
    Leave the carrot as it is.

## 原因、目的、结果副词从句

### 原因

    The rabbit ate the carrot **because the he was hungry**.  

    Since you are hungry, you can eat the carrot.  
    既然你饿了，……

    As you were you not here, we ate the carrot without you.  
    因为你之前不在这，

因果/语气  
bucause > since > as  

语序  
because引导的从句，在主句前后都可以  
since/as的从句，一般只能放在主句之前  

### 目的

目的A(从句) <- 事件B(主句)

**In order that I could finish the video in time**, I pulled an all-nighter.

一般使用情态助词can, could, may, might, should, would等，为了更好体现目的性  

### 结果

I ate a lot of carrots for lunch so that I wasn't hungry at all in the afternoon.  

The temperature was low so that the lake froze.
