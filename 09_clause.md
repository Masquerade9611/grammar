# 从句

## 从句的原理

### 句子成分

句子成分上来说，除谓语动词以外所有的句子成分都可以用从句代替

**主语** + 动词
主语 + 动词 + **宾语**
主语 + 动词 + 间接宾语 + 直接宾语
主语 + 动词 + 宾语 + **（宾语）补语**
主语 + 动词 + **（主语）补语（表语）**
**定语**，**状语**，**同位语**

### 词类/词性

名词性从句
    - 主语从句
    - 宾语
    - 表语
    - 宾语补语
    - 同位语

形容词性从句
    - 定语从句

副词性从句
    - 状语从句
        - 时间状语
        - 地点状语
        - 条件，原因，方式，比较…状语从句

## 形容词从句 / 定语从句

### 思维方式

The rabbit is eating a carrot.

中：兔子在吃一根（我买来的）胡萝卜。
英：兔子在吃一根胡萝卜（[胡萝卜的关系词]我买）。

### 构成

The rabbit is eating carrots（先行词） **that（关系词） I bought**（定语从句）.

关系词
    - 关系代词
    - 关系副词

关系代词  
that vs. whitch  
先行词是唯一的：that  
先行词是多选一的：which  

    The rabbit ate **the largest carrot** that I've ever seen.
    The rabbit ate a carrot which I bought.

关系副词  
This was the place where the rabbit ate the carrot.  
This is the reason why the rabbit ate the carrot.  
That was the day when the rabbit ate the carrot for the first time.  

    转为关系代词
    the place **at which**
    the reason **for which**
    the day **on which**
关系副词 = 介词 + which

### 限定性和非限定性

限定性形容词从句
    The rabbit ate the carrot which was on the table.
    限定了carrot的范围、性质

非限定性形容词从句
    The rabbit ate the carrot, **which** was on the table.
    一前一后两段话，which表示"接着说"

I have a head which is round.
I have a head, which is round.

非限定性形容词从句作插入语
    My head, **which is big**, is useful when it rains.  
    The biggest carrot, **which the rabbit ate**, was on the table.  
    仅作补充信息作用，删除后无影响

非限定性形容词从句指代整句话
    The rabbit ate the carrot, **which** was not surprising.  
    which指代“兔子吃了胡萝卜”这件事

## 名词从句

- 主语从句
- 宾语
- 表语
- 宾语补语
- 同位语

### 主语从句

The fact is obvious.  

**That** the rabbit ate a carrot is obvious.  
（引导词，从属连词）
**Whether** the rabbit ate a carrot is obvious.  
**Where** the rabbit ate a carrot is obvious.  
**When** the rabbit ate a carrot is obvious.  
**How** the rabbit ate a carrot is obvious.  
**Who** ate a carrot is obvious.

### 宾语从句

1. 确定信息 & 不确定信息

    确定信息作宾语
    I saw that the rabbit ate a carrot.

    不确定信息作宾语
    I saw whether the rabbit ate a carrot.  
    I saw who ate the carrot.  
    I saw what the rabbit ate.

    when
    how

2. 引导词that的省略

3. 某些词后的宾语从句的否定

    否定加在谓语动词前，而非从句中
    I think (that) the rabbit is smart.
    -> I don't think (that) the rabbit is smart.

    I don't believe (that) you will give me some conins.  
    I don't except (that) you will give this video a thumps-up.  

4. 主从时态一致

    主句时态 = 宾语从句时态  
    I don't think you're right.  
    I didn't think you were right.  
    I knew the rabbit liked carrots.  
    （例外：不变的客观现象）
    I knew the sun raise in the east.

5. be + 形容词 + that ...

    I am sure that there's a carrot on the table.  
    I am happy that there's a carrot on the table.  
    I am afraid that there's no carrot on the table.  

    根据语义理解不同，可能划分为宾语从句、同位语从句、状语从句

### 表语从句

I（主语） am(系动词，“划等号”) a rabbit（主语补语）.  
The carrot tastes good.  

系动词：be动词  
    The problem is **that** the rabbit is hungry.  
    The reason is **that** there's no more carrot.  
    The question is **whether** the rabbit is hungry.  
    The question is **what** the rabbit shoud eat.  
    The question is **where/when/how** the rabbit should eat the carrot.  

系动词：非be动词  
    It seems that the rabbit is hungry.  
    It feels that you're not telling the truth.  

### 同位语从句

The fact **that** the rabbit ate the carrot did not surprise me.  
The question **whether** the rabbit will eat the carrot is on all our minds.  
I have no idea **who** ate the carrot.  
（宾语idea，后接的同位语从句将idea重新定义）

### 宾语补语从句

    复杂及物动词  ->  主语 + 动词 + 宾语 + 宾语补语

You can call me Papa Rabbit.  
You can call me what you like.  

My education made me who I am today.
