# Arknights - Eyjafjalla the Hv√≠t Aska Preview

You see, Adele  
Magma is formed from molten rocks.  
They are usually packed tightly to each other deep under this Land.  
Rocks are pulled along by the slow,  
drifting mantle before colliding with other rocks at faraway places.  
Though separated by vast distances,  
they all converge into a singular lifeforce of molten heat.  
With the long darkness endured they will at last emerge in a brilliant eruption.  

It's a blossom, producing a haze full of heat and life.  
Then a withering, all cools down and solidify.  
In the end, they fall back onto the land, invigorating its soil,  
on which everything that grows will do so.  

However, those mountains of fire can also exact a deadly toll,  
scarring the Land with terrible burns...  
...and leaving scant hope for those who survive.  
We want to know if there is a way to stop volcanoes from taking more lives.  
Minerals, temperature, gases, seismic vibrations...
What exactly gives this Land its heartbeat?
What causes its blood to seethe and boil?
The unaided human eye can barely fathom the immensity of geological time.  
Our existence is simply too short.  

Yet at this very brief moment,  
I can easily gaze upon this beauteous sceenery  
and you, Adele.  
We have witnessed instances of crustal movements and vast seas of sputtering lava.
If felt as though we had lived multiple lifetimes.  
We are the fortunate few who found a mystery that both of us fell in love with.  

If only...  
...the magma coursing through this Land had flowed a little slower.
