# 独立主格

    Because he was invited by the wolf, the rabbit decided to go to the party.
    -- 非谓语动词 -->
    (因为与rabbit之间为被动关系，故使用过去分词)
    Invited by the wolf, the rabbit decided to go to the party.

    Because the wolf invited him, the rabbit decided to go to the party.
    -- 非谓语动词/独立主格 -->
    (wolf是邀请者，主动关系使用现在分词)
    The wolf inviting him, the rabbit decided to go to the party.
    invite的动作不是由真正的主语rabbit发出，而是由wolf发出，wolf即为“逻辑主语”，游离于真正主语之外的主语，即“独立主格”。

    If the weather permits, the rabbit will go out.
    -- 独立主格 -->
    The weather permitting, the rabbit will go out.

    (时间状语从句)
    After the work finished, the rabbit went home.
    -->

    The rabbit is lying in bed and a carrot is still held in his hand.
