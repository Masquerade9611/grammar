# 非谓语动词 Non-finite verbs

## 谓语动词与非谓语动词

### 谓语动词

三大本领：表达动作的“时间”，“状态”，“语气”，通过动词变位实现。  
受限定，即限定性动词（finite verbs.）
句子的核心

### 非谓语动词

不受限定，即非限定性动词（non-finite verbs.）。故无法表达时间，状态，语气。  
句子非核心部分

    I like to eat carrots.
    I liked eating carrots.
    I am a talking rabbit.
    The rabbit likes minced carrots

简单句结构为“什么+怎么样”，故只能存在一个谓语动词来表达“怎么样”，其余部分只能为非谓语动词。

## 动词不定式

通常为to + 动词原形
    To be or not to be, that is the question.  
    You helped me (to) cook the carrot.  

### 不定式作主语

    To eat a carrot every day is good for the rabbit.
    ->
    It is good for the rabbit to eat a carrot every day.
    (形式主语 it)
    it is + 形容词 + for sb. + to do sth.

### 不定式作宾语

    The rabbit likes to eat carrots.  

    I consider(复杂及物动词) the rabbit(宾语) smart(宾语补足语).

    I consider it important to eat a carrot every day.
    (形式宾语it，代表后面的不定式)

### 不定式作宾语补语

    The rabbit expected(复杂及物动词) the wolf(宾语) to eat a carrot(宾语补语).  
    Carrots make the rabbit feel happy.  
    The wold helped the rabbit (to) grow carrots.  

### 不定式作主语补语

    [The rabbit's dream] is(系动词，表"==") [to eat every kind of carrots in the world].

### 不定式作定语

    The rabbit has a lot of carrots to eat(后置定语).

### 不定式作状语

    表原因
    I was surprised to get a thumbs-up.
    -> 
    I was surprised because I got a thumbs-up.（原因状语从句）

    表目的
    I will do anything to get a thumbs-up.
    ->
    I will do anything in order that I get a thumbs-up.（目的状语从句）

    表结果
    I got enough thumbs-up to make another video.
    ->
    I got enough thumbs-up, so that I made another video.（结果状语从句）

### 高级不定式

to + 动词原形（“状态”）
    to be eating a carrot
    to have eaten a carrot
    to have been eating a carrot
