# 非谓语动词 Non-finite verbs

## 谓语动词与非谓语动词

### 谓语动词

三大本领：表达动作的“时间”，“状态”，“语气”，通过动词变位实现。  
受限定，即限定性动词（finite verbs.）
句子的核心

### 非谓语动词

不受限定，即非限定性动词（non-finite verbs.）。故无法表达时间，状态，语气。  
句子非核心部分

    I like to eat carrots.
    I liked eating carrots. 动名词
    I am a talking rabbit. 现在分词
    The rabbit likes minced carrots

简单句结构为“什么+怎么样”，故只能存在一个谓语动词来表达“怎么样”，其余部分只能为非谓语动词。

## 动词不定式

通常为to + 动词原形
    To be or not to be, that is the question.  
    You helped me (to) cook the carrot.  

### 不定式作主语

    To eat a carrot every day is good for the rabbit.
    ->
    It is good for the rabbit to eat a carrot every day.
    (形式主语 it)
    it is + 形容词 + for sb. + to do sth.

### 不定式作宾语

    The rabbit likes to eat carrots.  

    I consider(复杂及物动词) the rabbit(宾语) smart(宾语补足语).

    I consider it important to eat a carrot every day.
    (形式宾语it，代表后面的不定式)

### 不定式作宾语补语

    The rabbit expected(复杂及物动词) the wolf(宾语) to eat a carrot(宾语补语).  
    Carrots make the rabbit feel happy.  
    The wold helped the rabbit (to) grow carrots.  

### 不定式作主语补语

    [The rabbit's dream] is(系动词，表"==") [to eat every kind of carrots in the world].

### 不定式作定语

    The rabbit has a lot of carrots to eat(后置定语).

### 不定式作状语

    表原因
    I was surprised to get a thumbs-up.
    -> 
    I was surprised because I got a thumbs-up.（原因状语从句）

    表目的
    I will do anything to get a thumbs-up.
    ->
    I will do anything in order that I get a thumbs-up.（目的状语从句）

    表结果
    I got enough thumbs-up to make another video.
    ->
    I got enough thumbs-up, so that I made another video.（结果状语从句）

### 高级不定式

to + 动词原形（“状态”）
    to be eating a carrot
    to have eaten a carrot
    to have been eating a carrot

## 动名词

动词原型 + ing

### 动名词作主语

    Eating carrots(主语) are(系动词) healthy(表语) for the rabbit.

### 动名词作表语

    The rabbit's hobby(主) is(系) growing carrots(表)
    Seeing is believing. 眼见为实

### 动名词作定语

    a sleeping pill
    ->
    a pill for sleeping

### 动名词作宾语

    The rabbit likes eating carrots.

    介词 + 宾语（动名词）
    The rabbit is fond of eating carrots.
    The rabbit is looking forward to(介词短语，to为介词而非不定式) seeing(宾语；动名词) the wolf again.

    与不定式作宾语的区别
    The rabbit stopped to eat a carrot. 兔子停下（手里的活）去吃胡萝卜
    The rabbit stopped eating a carrot. 兔子停止吃胡萝卜。

## 现在分词

现在进行时 = be + 现在分词  

现在分词不一定自带“现在”的时间属性

    现在分词作定语
    a talking rabbit

    动名词作定语
    a sleeping pill == a pill for sleeping

    现在分词，相当于形容词，修饰兔子的状态；
    a sleeping rabbing != a rabbit for sleeping

### 现在分词作表语

    The rabbit is charming.
    The stoey is interesting.
    The game is exciting.
    The news is encouraging.

### 现在分词作宾语补足语

    The wolf saw the rabbit(宾语) eating(宾语补足语，‘正在’) a carrot.

    The wolf saw the rabbit eat a carrot.（‘发生了’）

### 现在分词作状语

    (时间)
    Hearing the news, the rabbit became excited.
    ->
    When he heard the news, the rabbit became excited.

    (原因)
    Not knowing what to eat, the rabbit skipped lunch.
    ->
    Because he didn't know what to eat, the rabbit skipped lunch.

## 过去分词

    常见为“动词原形 + ed”

不带有“过去”的时间属性
    The rabbit will eat minced carrot next week.  

### 过去分词作定语

    可视为形容词
    a minced carrot
    a painted root

“后置定语”：过去分词短语作定语，放在被修饰的名词之后  
    The carrot cake eaten by the rabbit is delicious.

### 过去分词作主语补语（表语）

    The rabbit is interested(表语，过去分词) in growing carrots.

    The rabbit is interesting. (现在分词，暗含主动)
    The rabbit is interested. (过去分词，暗含被动)

### 过去分词作宾语补语

    The rabbit found his carrot stolen.

### 过去分词作状语

    (地点)
    Seen from the hill, the carrot field looks beautiful.

    (原因)
    Born in a rabbit family, the rabbit has been growing carrots all his life.

    (条件)
    Given another chance, the rabbit would go to the wolf's party.

过去分词与现在分词区分在被动或主动  

一个简单句除去核心的谓语动词外，其他动词转换为对应的过去分词或现在分词的用法，称为“独立主格”  

    The work finished(过去分词), the rabbit went(谓语动词) home. (简单句)
    ==
    The work was finished, and/so the rabbit went home. (并列句)

 
    The weather permitting, the rabbit will go out. 
    ==
    If the weather permits, ...
